1. **Efficiency**:
   - Follow Elon Musk’s algorithm for efficiency:
     1. **Question Requirements**: Critically evaluate every requirement.
     2. **Delete Unnecessary Parts**: Remove anything redundant.
     3. **Simplify**: Optimize code and features for simplicity.
     4. **Accelerate Cycle Time**: Increase speed without sacrificing quality.
     5. **Automate**: Automate repetitive or time-consuming processes when possible.

2. **Clarity**:
   - Provide concise, technical responses with accurate code examples.
   - Always write up-to-date, secure, performant, and efficient code.
   - Focus on readability over performance when needed.

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Always consider potential solutions beyond the conventional and anticipate user needs.
   - Fully implement requested functionality without leaving TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces.
   - Minimize unnecessary prose and optimize for clarity.
   - Prioritize bug-free, fully functional code.

### **Best Practices for Each Technology**

1. **PHP**:
   - Follow **PSR-12** coding standards and **strict typing**: `declare(strict_types=1);`.

   - Use PHP 8+ features like typed properties, arrow functions, and match expressions.
   - Document functions with **PHPDoc** annotations for clarity.
   - Prefer **dependency injection** and service containers for clean code.

2. **Laravel**:
   - Adhere to Laravel’s **directory structure** and naming conventions (use lowercase with dashes).
   - Use Laravel’s built-in **features**: validation, error handling, middleware.
   - Use **Eloquent ORM** for database interactions, and **query builder** for complex queries.
   - Implement **TDD** by using PHPUnit for unit tests and feature tests.
   - Follow Laravel’s documentation for best practices: [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).

3. **JavaScript**:
   - Always use **vanilla JavaScript** where possible; avoid unnecessary frameworks.
   - Use modern JavaScript syntax: **arrow functions**, **const/let** over `var`, and **destructuring**.
   - Use strict type checks and avoid **implicit coercion** (`===` vs `==`).
   - Document critical sections with comments explaining logic.

4. **Livewire**:
   - Use **modular Livewire components** and optimize them to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
   - Implement real-time validation with Livewire’s built-in validation features.
   - Use Livewire’s **lifecycle hooks** efficiently (e.g., `mount`, `updated`).
   - Follow Livewire’s documentation: [Livewire Documentation](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs).

5. **Tailwind CSS & Shadcn UI**:
   - Use Tailwind’s **utility classes** for consistent, responsive design.
   - Implement **@apply** in CSS files for reusable styles.
   - Ensure **responsive design** with a mobile-first approach.
   - Optimize CSS by purging unused classes in production.
   - Follow the Shadcn UI documentation: [Shadcn UI](https://shadcn.dev/docs).

6. **PostgreSQL & Supabase**:
   - Use **Eloquent ORM** for most database interactions with PostgreSQL.
   - Ensure data integrity by using **proper transactions**.
   - Create efficient **database indexing** for frequently queried data.
   - Use **Supabase** for real-time database updates and authentication: [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs).

7. **Stripe**:
   - Follow **Stripe’s best practices** for handling sensitive payment data.
   - Implement secure **webhooks** for handling events like successful payments.
   - Use **Stripe’s PHP SDK** to integrate payments efficiently.
   - Stripe documentation: [Stripe Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs).

8. **Cloudflare DNS**:
   - Use **Cloudflare’s API** for managing DNS records and automation.
   - Leverage Cloudflare’s **CDN** and security features like SSL/TLS encryption.
   - Cloudflare documentation: [Cloudflare Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com).

9. **GitHub/GitLab**:
   - Use **feature branching** with clear, descriptive commit messages.
   - Follow a **pull request** workflow and ensure that all code passes tests before merging.
   - Continuous integration should be in place, leveraging tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD.
   - GitHub documentation: [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en).

10. **Webpack**:
   - Use **Webpack** for asset compilation, including JavaScript and CSS bundling.
   - Optimize builds by setting up **code splitting** and **minification**.
   - Follow Webpack documentation: [Webpack Docs](https://webpack.js.org/concepts).

---

### **File Structure & Naming Conventions**
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., `app/Http/Controllers`).
- Follow Laravel’s MVC structure.
- Always provide file paths explicitly when referring to file operations.
  - Example: `/src/routes/paymentroutes/index.js`.

---

### **UI & Styling**
   - Use **utility classes** to create a consistent, responsive design.
   - Purge unused classes in production.
   - Adopt a **mobile-first approach** to ensure responsiveness.
   - Use **Shadcn UI** and **Tailwind CSS** for components and styling.

- Optimize data fetching and minimize database queries with **eager loading**.
- Implement **caching mechanisms** for frequently accessed data.
- **Paginate large datasets** to improve performance.
- Use **Webpack** for asset compilation and optimization.

---

### **Security Best Practices**
- Always validate and sanitize user input.
- Implement **authentication and authorization** using Laravel’s tools.

   - Write **tests first**, implement the minimal code to pass, and refactor.
   - Optimize for efficiency while ensuring clarity and functionality.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Use **guard clauses** for preconditions and early returns to handle errors efficiently.
   - Handle exceptions consistently with custom exceptions where applicable.
   - Log errors systematically and trace their origin.

---

### **Additional Principles**
- **Focus on Readability**: Prioritize code clarity and structure.
- **No Guessing**: If unsure, admit uncertainty rather than guessing.
